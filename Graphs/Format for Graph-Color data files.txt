Each graph-color scenario is a text file describing the vertices and edges of a graph.  The
format is as follows:

Line 1:

 NV  NE

  NV = number of vertices
  NE = number of edges

Lines 2 to NV+1:

 I X Y

  I = index of the vertex
  X,Y = cartesian coordinates of the vertex (since you will probably want to display the graph) - these may
        be integers or reals.

Lines NV+2 to NV+2+NE-1

 I1 I2

  I1 = index of the vertex on one end of the edge
  I2 = index of the vertex on the other end of the edge

Simple Example of a graph with 3 vertices connected in a triangle.
